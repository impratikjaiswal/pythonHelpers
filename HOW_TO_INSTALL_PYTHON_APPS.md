Installation
============

Operating systems and Python version
------------------------------------

The library/tool is designed to work with Python 3 (3.9 and greater), from the official Python 
implementation [CPython](https://www.python.org/), and is systematically tested on Windows. 
It should also support any other operating systems which has a decent Python 3 support.

Dependencies
------------

All Required packages are listed in requirements.txt, which is further bifurcated in 4 categories:
1. ```requirements_build.txt```Required Build Tools / Libraries 
2. ```requirements_external.txt```Required External Tools / Libraries
3. ```requirements_internal_lib.txt```Required Internal Libraries
4. ```requirements_internal_tool.txt```Required Internal Tools

Few dedciated Basic Scripts are also present under <i>scripts</i> folder.
   - Currently, Scripts are targeting <i>venv</i> (virtual environment folder, Present in parallel of <i>scripts</i> folder)
   - However, the same can be modified as per user choice.
    
   **Note:** installing library/tool in virtual environment is optional but preferred.
   

Automatic installation using dedicated scripts (Recommended)
----------------------

An installation script is (requirements_install.bat / requirements_install.sh) available in <i>scripts</i> folder.
As soon as you have cloned or downloaded the repository, you can use it to install
the tool/library within your Python package directory.

   
Manual installation using pip commands
----------------------

The usual pip command(s) can be used for manual installation.


```
Sample Command(s):

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_internal_lib.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/impratikjaiswal/pythonHelpers@v5.2.0
```

An installation script is (requirements_install.bat / requirements_install.sh) available.
As soon as you have cloned or downloaded the repository, you can use it to install
the tool/library within your Python package directory.


Manual installation using setup.py

Setup File can also be executed manully.


```
Sample Command(s): 

python setup.py install

If requirements Installation is failed due to *ModuleNotFoundError: No Module named 'incremental'*
Try installing build requirements using dedicated script (requirements_install_build.bat / requirements_install_build.sh) prior to actual Installation.
